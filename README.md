## What is this?

Just like this [repository](https://github.com/mdayat/algorithm), i decided to document my learning on data structures from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/). I'll say it twice, Boot Dev is really great website to learn backend development the fun way, go check it out. The Data Structures course provided by Boot Dev is demonstrated in Python, but i use Go instead because it's part of my journey to become a Go developer.
